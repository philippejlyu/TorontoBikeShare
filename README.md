# TorontoBikeShare

When I'm commuting to class in Toronto, to get from my apartment to class, I'd rather bike for 5 minutes than walk for 15 minutes.
Since it's dangerous (and illegal) to use your phone while biking on a road, I decided to develop this hands free Apple Watch app
to be able to find the nearest bike station with available returns. 

The app takes data from the City of Toronto's open data services.
